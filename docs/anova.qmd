In the [PFOS paper from 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-017-2077-8), PFOS in different doses and exposure times was applied and correlated with phenotypes such as proliferation, invation and migration. Here, we will reproduce the statistics and the figures for [figure 1F](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-017-2077-8/figures/1) and [figure 3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-017-2077-8/figures/3). 

```{r}
# Once per machine
#install.packages("forcats") 	# <1>

# Every R session
library(forcats) 							# <2>
```

1. Install packages with `install.packages("<package-name>")`, use quotes
2. Load library with `library(<package-name>)`

## Proliferation

Figure 1F shows the proliferation phenotype over mulitple doses of PFOS. Proliferation is translated into how the cells are dividing by observing number of cell nuclei with a staining method called [DAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAPI).

Import the dataset, will be contained inside a "data frame", and inspect it with the `head()` and `summary()` functions:

```{r}
# Import dataset
dat <- read.csv("../data/proliferation.csv")

# head shows the top 6 rows of a data frame
head(dat)

# summary shows ranges and types per column
summary(dat)
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true title="What can you read about the dataset?"}
The data frame is composed of 2 columns and 52 rows.

Lets make a simple plot! 

The `plot()` function can read a data frame and recognice that the variable column is categorical and the value column is numeric. With this a box-plot figure is built where `x = variable` and `y = value`:

```{r}
# Make variable column into factor (categorical)
# forcats::fct_inorder makes the categorices of the column the order they appear
dat$variable <- fct_inorder(dat$variable)

# Plot time!
plot(dat)
```

The plot function also takes in additional _arguments_, like `main`, `ylab` and `xlab`.

```{r}
# main = title
# ylab = text on y-axis
# xlab = text on x-asis
plot(dat, main = "Proliferation", ylab = "DAPI Positive cells", xlab = "")
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true title="Function arguments"}

All functions in R comes with documentation, where the function and all the arguments the function takes in are described. To open the documentation use the question mark `?` before the name of the function, like `?plot` will show:

```yml
plot                   package:base                    R Documentation

Generic X-Y Plotting

Description:

     Generic function for plotting of R objects.

     For simple scatter plots, ‘plot.default’ will be used.  However,
     there are ‘plot’ methods for many R objects, including
     ‘function’s, ‘data.frame’s, ‘density’ objects, etc.  Use
     ‘methods(plot)’ and the documentation for these. Most of these
     methods are implemented using traditional graphics (the ‘graphics’
     package), but this is not mandatory.
```

To exit the documentation, press `q`.

R comes with many packages to help customise plots. [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is the most popular one and builts on "layers" of geometic objects, called `geom`. The dataset is loaded via the `ggplot()` function and mapped via aesthetics (`aes`). Aesthetics contols x, y, outline colors, inside fill colors, sizes, shapes etc.

Lets style the plot with `ggplot2`! Run the code below:

```{r}
# Ones per machine
#install.packages("ggplot2")

# Every R sessoin
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_bar(fun = "mean", stat = "summary", color = "black") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  labs(
    title = "Proliferation",
    x = "",
    y = "DAPI Positive cells")
```

The legend is not needed, remove it with `theme(legend.position = "none")`:

```{r code-line-numbers="4"}
ggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_bar(fun = "mean", stat = "summary", color = "black") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + # default: legend.position = "right"
  labs(
    title = "Proliferation",
    x = "",
    y = "DAPI Positive cells")
```

We need to add "whiskers" to the plot, which shows mean +/- standard deviation, i.e the variance. Use `geom_errorbar`: 

```{r}
ggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_bar(fun = "mean", stat = "summary", color = "black") +
  
  geom_errorbar(
  	stat = "summary",												# calculated on each group
    fun.min = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x),	# bottom whisker
    fun.max = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x), 	# top whisker
    width = 0.4) + 													# width of whiskars
  
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Proliferation",
    x = "",
    y = "DAPI Positive cells")
```

Tilt the x-axis text 45 degress. `theme` holds all arguments for the plots general appearence:

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true title="theme documentation"}
Check the doumentation: `?theme`

Close with `q`.
:::

```{r}
ggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_bar(fun = "mean", stat = "summary", color = "black") +
  geom_errorbar(
  	stat = "summary",
    fun.min = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x),
    fun.max = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x),
    width = 0.4) + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  
  theme(
  	legend.position = "none",
  	axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + # hjust = right-justifed
  
  labs(
    title = "Proliferation",
    x = "",
    y = "DAPI Positive cells")
```


### Statistics

Lets compare the group means of the different doses to see if there is any significant differences! An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) analysis will tells us if there is a difference between the tested groups, but not between which. For this we run a _post-hoc_ (lat. after this) test. Since our tested groups are of **unequal** size we apply the Tukey-Kramer test. The group distribution can be seen with the [`table()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/table) function which builts a [contingency table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table).

```{r}
# Check group sizes
table(dat$variable)
```



, run ANOVA w/ Tukey Kramer posthoc test.

An ANOVA will tell us if there is a difference between the tested groups, but not between which. A posthoc 

tests all pairwise comparison and 



You want all pairwise comparisons while controlling family-wise error rate (FWER).

Why Tukey vs Tukey–Kramer
Use Tukey’s HSD when:

You want all pairwise mean comparisons

Group sizes are equal (or nearly equal)

Use Tukey–Kramer when:

You want all pairwise mean comparisons

Group sizes are unequal (unbalanced design)

Tukey–Kramer is essentially Tukey’s method generalized to unequal n’s, keeping FWER controlled across all pairs.

```{r}
