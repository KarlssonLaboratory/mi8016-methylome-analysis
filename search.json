With this a box-plot figure is built where x = variable and y = value:\n\n# Make variable column into factor (categorical)\n# forcats::fct_inorder makes the categorices of the column the order they appear\ndat$variable &lt;- fct_inorder(dat$variable)\n\n# Plot time!\nplot(dat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot function also takes in additional arguments, like main, ylab and xlab.\n\n# main = title\n# ylab = text on y-axis\n# xlab = text on x-asis\nplot(dat, main = \"Proliferation\", ylab = \"DAPI Positive cells\", xlab = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFunction arguments\n\n\n\n\n\nAll functions in R comes with documentation, where the function and all the arguments the function takes in are described. To open the documentation use the question mark ? before the name of the function, like ?plot will show:\nplot                   package:base                    R Documentation\n\nGeneric X-Y Plotting\n\nDescription:\n\n     Generic function for plotting of R objects.\n\n     For simple scatter plots, ‘plot.default’ will be used.  However,\n     there are ‘plot’ methods for many R objects, including\n     ‘function’s, ‘data.frame’s, ‘density’ objects, etc.  Use\n     ‘methods(plot)’ and the documentation for these. Most of these\n     methods are implemented using traditional graphics (the ‘graphics’\n     package), but this is not mandatory.\nTo exit the documentation, press q.\n\n\n\nR comes with many packages to help customise plots. ggplot2 is the most popular one and builts on “layers” of geometic objects, called geom. The dataset is loaded via the ggplot() function and mapped via aesthetics (aes). Aesthetics contols x, y, outline colors, inside fill colors, sizes, shapes etc.\nLets style the plot with ggplot2! Run the code below:\n\n# Ones per machine\n#install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\n# Every R sessoin\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(fun = \"mean\", stat = \"summary\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proliferation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"DAPI Positive cells\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legend is not needed, remove it with theme(legend.position = \"none\"):\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(fun = \"mean\", stat = \"summary\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + # default: legend.position = \"right\"\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Proliferation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"DAPI Positive cells\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to add “whiskers” to the plot, which shows mean +/- standard deviation, i.e the variance. Use geom_errorbar:\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(fun = \"mean\", stat = \"summary\", color = \"black\") +\n  \n  geom_errorbar(\n    stat = \"summary\",                                               # calculated on each group\n    fun.min = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x),  # bottom whisker\n    fun.max = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x),  # top whisker\n    width = 0.4) +                                                  # width of whiskars\n  \n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proliferation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"DAPI Positive cells\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTilt the x-axis text 45 degress. theme holds all arguments for the plots general appearence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiptheme documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the doumentation: ?theme\nClose with q.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(fun = \"mean\", stat = \"summary\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(\n    stat = \"summary\",\n    fun.min = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x),\n    fun.max = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x),\n    width = 0.4) + \n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n  \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + # hjust = right-justifed\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Proliferation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"DAPI Positive cells\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics\nLets compare the group means of the different doses to see if there is any significant differences! An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) analysis will tells us if there is a difference between the tested groups, but not between which. For this we run a post-hoc (lat. after this) test. Since our tested groups are of unequal size we apply the Tukey-Kramer test. The group distribution can be seen with the table() function which builts a contingency table.\n\n# Check group sizes\ntable(dat$variable)\n\n\nControl  100 nM    1 uM   10 uM   50 uM  100 um  250 uM  500 uM    1 mM \n      6       6       6       6       6       6       6       6       6 \n\n\n, run ANOVA w/ Tukey Kramer posthoc test.\nAn ANOVA will tell us if there is a difference between the tested groups, but not between which. A posthoc\ntests all pairwise comparison and\nYou want all pairwise comparisons while controlling family-wise error rate (FWER).\nWhy Tukey vs Tukey–Kramer Use Tukey’s HSD when:\nYou want all pairwise mean comparisons\nGroup sizes are equal (or nearly equal)\nUse Tukey–Kramer when:\nYou want all pairwise mean comparisons\nGroup sizes are unequal (unbalanced design)\nTukey–Kramer is essentially Tukey’s method generalized to unequal n’s, keeping FWER controlled across all pairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANOVA and Tukey Kramer posthoc test"

For that, integrated development environment (IDE) can be used, which offer sets of tools built to help you be more productive."

First, let’s take a high-level, side-by-side view of the two IDEs. This figure highlights the role each area plays in your workflow and draws similarities between Positron and RStudio. You write code in an editor, run your code in the Console, and view outputs like plots, variables, and reports in dedicated panes or tabs.\n\n\n\nComparison of RStudio and Positron user interfaces\n\n\nHowever, there are few differences.\n\n\n\nInterface of the Positron IDE\n\n\nTwo specific UI elements are the most novel for RStudio users:\n\nThe Activity Bar provides access to different functional capabilities of Positron.
