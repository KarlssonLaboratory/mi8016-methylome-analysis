However,\n     there are ‘plot’ methods for many R objects, including\n     ‘function’s, ‘data.frame’s, ‘density’ objects, etc.  Use\n     ‘methods(plot)’ and the documentation for these. Most of these\n     methods are implemented using traditional graphics (the ‘graphics’\n     package), but this is not mandatory.\nTo exit the documentation, press q.\n\n\n\nR comes with many packages to help customise plots. ggplot2 is the most popular one and builts on “layers” of geometic objects, called geom. The dataset is loaded via the ggplot() function and mapped via aesthetics (aes). Aesthetics contols x, y, outline colors, inside fill colors, sizes, shapes etc.\nLets style the plot with ggplot2! Run the code below:\n\n# Ones per machine\n#install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\n# Every R sessoin\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n1ggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n2  geom_bar(fun = \"mean\", stat = \"summary\", color = \"black\") +\n3  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n4  labs(\n    title = \"Proliferation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"DAPI Positive cells\")\n\n\n1\n\nBy adding a plus sign + multiple rows are chained fo the plot\n\n2\n\ngeom_bar() uses the mean to calculate the top part of the bar\n\n3\n\ntheme_classic() is on of many themes for decorating a plot. base_size sets the overall size.\n\n4\n\nlabs() holds arguments for text inputs for title, x-axis, y-axis, etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legend is not needed, remove it with theme(legend.position = \"none\"):\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(fun = \"mean\", stat = \"summary\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n1  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proliferation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"DAPI Positive cells\")\n\n\n1\n\nlegend.position is set to “none” and therefor not rendered. Default value is: legend.position = “right”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to add “whiskers” to the plot, which shows mean +/- standard deviation, i.e the variance. Use geom_errorbar:\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(fun = \"mean\", stat = \"summary\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(\n    stat = \"summary\",\n1    fun.min = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x),\n2    fun.max = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x),\n3    width = 0.4) +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proliferation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"DAPI Positive cells\")\n\n\n1\n\nBottom whisker\n\n2\n\nTop whisker\n\n3\n\nWidth of whiskars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTilt the x-axis text 45 degress. theme holds all arguments for the plots general appearence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiptheme documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the doumentation: ?theme\nClose with q.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(fun = \"mean\", stat = \"summary\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(\n    stat = \"summary\",\n    fun.min = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x),\n    fun.max = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x),\n    width = 0.4) + \n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n1    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proliferation\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"DAPI Positive cells\")\n\n\n1\n\nhjust = 1 aligns the text to right-justifed."

    "text": "Statistics\nLets compare the group means of the different doses to see if there is any significant differences! An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) analysis will tells us if there is a difference between the tested groups, but not between which. For this we run a post-hoc (lat. after this) test. The Tukey-Kramer test is post-hoc test that will tell us between which groups there is a difference.\nThe aov() function runs an ANOVA analysis. The formula argument reads y ~ x, hence we use value ~ variabale. The summary() function will show us the overall result of the ANOVA:\n\nmodel &lt;- aov(formula = value ~ variable, data = dat)\n\nsummary(model)\n\n            Df   Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nvariable     8 68450805 8556351   253.1 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   44  1487643   33810                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n1 observation deleted due to missingness\n\n\nThe Pr(&gt;F) column holds the p-values.
