First, let’s take a high-level, side-by-side view of the two IDEs. This figure highlights the role each area plays in your workflow and draws similarities between Positron and RStudio. You write code in an editor, run your code in the Console, and view outputs like plots, variables, and reports in dedicated panes or tabs.\n\n\n\nComparison of RStudio and Positron user interfaces\n\n\nHowever, there are few differences.\n\n\n\nInterface of the Positron IDE\n\n\nTwo specific UI elements are the most novel for RStudio users:\n\nThe Activity Bar provides access to different functional capabilities of Positron.
