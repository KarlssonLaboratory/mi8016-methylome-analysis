    + Make slide to follow-along for this
  + Use the table to generate figure 1 and 3
    + Make slide to follow-along for this
  + Write stand along code to reproduce the figures

# Computational analysis

## Alignment & coverage

+ alignment to the reference genome
+ calculation of the coverage of the CpG-sites

Output: coverage files (`*.cov.gz`)

## Differential methylation analysis

Identify:

+ **D**ifferentially **M**ethylated **R**egions (DMRs)
+ **D**ifferentially **M**ethylated **G**enes (DMGs), DMRs are overlay with genomic positions and any overlapping genes is concidored a DMG.
+ Enriched gene ontology terms

For this we need to complete these steps:

1. [Map CpG-sites](#1-map-cpg-sites)
2. [Extract Ensembl dataset](#2-extract-ensembl-dataset)
3. [Differentially methylated regions](#3-differentially-methylated-regions)
4. [Overlap DMRs with genomics regions](#4-overlap-dmrs-with-genomics-regions) 
5. Calculate gene ontology enrichment scores w/ over-representation analysis.
6. Generate a figure for the enriched gene ontology terms.

## 1. Map CpG-sites

Extract the exact positions of `CG`-motifs in the human genome, save as text file `data/cpg_positions.txt.gz`. This table will be used to filter out only the CpG-sites for downstream analysis. To generate the file run this in the terminal (or run the script inside Positron / Rstudio):

```sh
Rscript bin/cpg_positions.R
```

The script requires the following R-packages: `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38` and `readr`.

  <summary>How to install R-packages</summary><br>

  > Assuming you have R already installed
  
  Basic R-packages are installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (`install.packages()`) while bioinformatic R-packages are installed from [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) (`BiocManager::install()`). In order, to install from Bioconductor we need first to install the [Bioconductor Manager](https://bioconductor.org/install/), see code below:
  
  ```r
  # Install Bioconductor manager
  install.packages("BiocManager")
  
  # Install from CRAN
  install.packages("readr")
  
  # Install from Bioconductor
  BiocManager::install("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38")
  ```
  
  Install packages like this will download the latest version. Exact version numbers are important for reproducibility.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Run code with containers</summary><br>

  Use a singularity container with a pre-install environment (OS, R, packages). Run with apptainer / singularity

  ```sh
  # Save container as a variable
  METH_SIF='library://andreyhgl/singularity-r/methylome'

  # Run the container
  apptainer exec $METH_SIF Rscript bin/cpg_positions.R
  ```
</details>

Will generate `data/cpg_positions.txt.gz`.

## 2. Extract Ensembl dataset

[Ensembl](https://ensembl.org/) is a public project providing access to reference genomes and gene annotations. We will be extracting all the known coding and non-coding genes gene positions.

```sh
Rscript bin/ensembl.R
```

Will generate `data/ensembl_table.csv.gz`.

## 3. Differentially methylated regions

Calulate **D**ifferentially **M**ethylated **R**egions (DMRs) focusing on CpG-sites - but we still call them regions.

This script is computationally heavy: requires 500Gb ram, 10 cpus and runs for 1,5h. Hence, it's best ran on a computer cluster, like [UPPMAX](https://www.uu.se/centrum/uppmax/resurser/kluster). 

```sh
Rscript bin/diffmeth.R
```

Will generate `data/diffmeth.csv.gz`.

## 4. Overlap DMRs with genomics regions

Find out which genomic regions (promoter, exon, intron, intergenic, CpG-islands) overlap with the DMRs.

> [!NOTE] We'll need two tables that hold the information for CpG-islands position and genome annotations, both of which can be downloaded from University of [California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genomics Institute](https://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/index.html). These files are included in the repo, inside `data/`.

<details>
  <summary>Download genome annotations</summary><br>

  Annotations can be exported from the [Table Browser tool](https://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) at UCSC database. To download the annotations set the parameters as follow:

  + CpG-islands annotations, save as `cpgislands_GRCh38.bed`
  
  ```
  clade = "Mammals" 
  genome = "Human"
  assembly = "Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38)"
  group = "Regulation"
  track = "CpG-islands"
  table = "cpgIslandExt"
  output format = "BED"
  output filename = "cpgislands_GRCh38.bed"
  
  <click> "get output" 
  <click> "get BED"
  ```
  
  + [Refseq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RefSeq) annotations, save as `refseq_UCSC_GRCh38.bed`
  
  ```
  clade = "Mammals" 
  genome = "Human"
  assembly = "Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38)"
  group = "Genes and Gene Predictions"
  track = "NCBI RefSeq"
  table = "UCSC RefSeq (refGene)"
  output format = "BED"
  output filename = "refseq_UCSC_GRCh38.bed"
  
  <click> "get output" 
  <click> "get BED"
  ```
</details>

```sh
Rscript bin/methtable.R
```

Will generate `data/PFOS_MCF10A_DMR.csv.gz`

---

Make a table containing all the differentially methylated CpG-sites.

Run: `bin/diffmeth.R` (`sbatch diffmeth.slurm`), generates `table.csv`

```sh
# Testing in interaction session, 500Gb and 10 cpus needed
# salloc is custom script
salloc 5:00:00 500 10

#METH_SIF='library://andreyhgl/singularity-r/methylome'
apptainer shell $METH_SIF
```
